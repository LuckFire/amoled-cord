# v1.1.0
A few minor changes and additions.
- Made some things brighter, as they were too dark and not noticeable. This closes [issue #6](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord/issues/6) and [issue #7](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord/issues/7).
- Added **[Tropical](https://github.com/Tropix126)'s** [usrbg](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg), **[NYRI4](https://github.com/NYRI4)'s**[Discolored](https://github.com/NYRI4/Discolored) and colored user connections as new addons.
- Removed the bottom chat indicator bar. It appeared that most users disliked this, so I bonked it.
- Reconstructed the file structure a bit.

If you notice anything that is too dark for the theme, make an issue on this repo. Also, please leave feedback on how you feel about the new addons.

# v1.0.4
Probably unnecessary for a version bump, but BetterDiscord and Web support has finally been added! If you notice any issues, please read **[this part](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord#issue-reporting)** of the readme on issue reporting.

# v1.0.3
Some small enhancements.
- Updated the import for [Theme Source](https://github.com/luckfire/theme-source) to use the github pages link. 
- Added a new indicator for when the chatbar is active.

# v1.0.2
Hopefully a fix for the source not consistently importing.

# v1.0.1
Recent changes as [Theme Source](https://github.com/luckfire/theme-source) has been redone.
- Tinkered with the colors a bit, mainly the ones that still used Discord's default ones.
- A nicer looking light theme warning (thank you snapper c:).
- Version has been bumped down: v1.1.0 -> v1.0.1
- Redid the entire repo. Looks nicer, right?!

BetterDiscord & Web support will (hopefully) be coming soon!

# v1.0.0
Inital release.
